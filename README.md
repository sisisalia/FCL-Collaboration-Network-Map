# Organic Collaboration in a Multidisciplinary Research Institute

"Organic Collaboration in a Multidisciplinary Research Institute" is a research project of The Future Cities Laboratory(FCL) at Singapore-ETH Centre. This project will help to investigate the process behind the emergence of organic collaboration in a multidisciplinary research centre.

This project includes sub-projects: 
1. Collaboration Form (https://github.com/CrazyFrog81/FCL-Collaboration-Map)
2. Collaboration Network

# Collaboration Network

Collaboration Network is visualization of collaboration between researchers in FCL. It is implemented by using D3.js. The data used in visualization is gathered from 'Collaboration Form'.

The objectives of Collaboration Network are:
1. how certain project outcomes are influenced by different collaborators' characteristics and vice versa
2. how the researchers collaborate with one another based on their characteristics
3. if collaborations of multidisciplinary/multi-languages are more common than collaborations of single disciplinary/single language


## Getting Started

1. Downlaod all the files to Desktop
2. Change the database connection at 'DataRetrieval.php' file to same database used in 'Collaboration Form'
3. Go to terminal and to the root folder
4. Enter 'php -S localhost:8000'
5. Go to web browser (preferably Google Chrome) and enter URL 'localhost:8000'
