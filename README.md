# Organic Collaboration in a Multidisciplinary Research Institute

"Organic Collaboration in a Multidisciplinary Research Institute" is a research project of The Future Cities Laboratory(FCL) at Singapore-ETH Centre. This project will help to investigate the process behind the emergence of organic collaboration in a multidisciplinary research centre.

This project includes sub-projects: 
1. Collaboration Form (https://github.com/CrazyFrog81/FCL-Collaboration-Map)
2. Collaboration Network

# Collaboration Network

This sub-project is to visualize the connections between each individual with the projects and vice versa. By allowing filtering and sorting functions, the researchers will have a better insight on the emerging organic collaboration. This sub-project is implemented using D3.js.
